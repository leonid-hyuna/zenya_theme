				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> What is [site]?</span>
				<p>[site] is your entertainment hub; a media-streaming, subscription-based service offering users access to over millions of movies, books, music, and game titles.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> Why is there a charge from [site] on my credit card?</span>
				<p>[site] gives new members a free trial, so they can discover the platform first-handed. You will not be charged during the free trial. However, once the trial expires, you will be charged the monthly subscription fee, as per the Terms and Conditions, if you do not cancel.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> I don’t remember signing up, why am I being charged?</span>
				<p>If you're seeing charges from [descriptor] on your bank statement, but don't remember signing up yourself, check if someone else in your household might have access to your card details or if you have a joint account. If not, please contact us at support@[site]. Please include details about the dates and the amounts of the charges. To facilitate the search for your charges, the following information might be useful:<br/><br/>- Your first and last name, as well as any other names on the credit card which was charged.<br/>- Any email addresses you may have signed up with.<br/>- The last four digits of the card being charged (if you have a joint account or multiple cards linked to the same statement, please include the last four digits of those cards as well – please do not send full card numbers).<br/>- The date of the charge on your credit card.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> I signed up for a free trial. Why was my credit card charged?</span>
				<p>Sometimes a $0.01 or $1 hold may be applied to your credit or debit card. This is not a charge but a pre-authorization hold which is used to validate your account and will be released within 5-7 business days.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> Why was I billed when I upgraded to a multimedia premium account for $2.95?</span>
				<p>As indicated during the signup process, the premium account upgrade, when offered, gives you access to all our bonus content including games, music, books and movies. To avoid service interruptions, your membership automatically renews as a monthly Premium membership unless cancelled before the trial expires.<br/><br/>If cancelled, your Premium trial membership will revert to a Free Regular membership, for which there are no monthly fees.<br/><br/>For additional questions or concerns, we welcome you to contact our customer support team.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> Where can I find the terms of the 5-day trial?</span>
				<p>The terms of the 5-day trial can be read prior to selecting the 5-day trial option during the signup process. You may read the complete Terms and Conditions of our service at any time for additional details.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> How do I cancel my [site] account?</span>
				<p>Sorry to hear that you are having issues. To cancel your account you have to log in, go to „My Account” in the left-hand panel and click „Cancel Membership” button in „Membership” section and select the steps provided. That is it, your account and subscription are deleted and [site] will no longer charge your credit card.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> How can I confirm that my membership is cancelled?</span>
				<p>After cancelling your membership, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the email address you used to create your [site] account.<br/><br/>Since many web-based email providers such as Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo occasionally mistake confirmation emails as spam or junk, please be sure to check your spam/junk folders in order to ensure that the confirmation email was indeed received.<br/><br/>If you still cannot find your membership cancellation email, you may have mistyped your email address when signing up. In this case, please contact us and one of our agents will be able to assist you.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> What happens if I cancel my Premium membership?</span>
				<p>If you cancel your Premium membership, you may keep your [site] account as a free Regular member. There are no monthly fees for a Regular membership.</p>
				<span><img src="images/arrow.svg"> What is the refund policy?</span>
				<p>Customer Satisfaction is our main priority. That’s why our refund policy is simple: If, for any reason, you’re unhappy with [site], contact our customer support team and they’ll be happy to assist you. We grant full refunds - no questions asked - for any of the following reasons:<br/><br/>- <strong>Technical issues:</strong> You were unable to enjoy your membership due to technical issues stemming from [site].<br/>- <strong>Fraud:</strong> Your card was used by someone other than the card holder.<br/>- <strong>Payment Error:</strong> You were erroneously charged by [site].<br/>- <strong>Forgot to cancel:</strong> If you forgot to cancel your membership after your free trial expired and you haven’t used [site] since, we’ll give you a full refund. No problem.</p>
